It is written in theTools in Data Sciencethat we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLIghwhich we have to install in the vercel instance usingaptpackage manager.But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first installngrokpackage.In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requiresdockerpackage installed.In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?And many moreMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.Also, some ques requires external toolings likeIn GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear likeIn GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided fromhttps://aiproxy.sanand.workers.devwill be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.",

It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.Thanks and RegardsShalini",

For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)AI Editors: Copilot, CursorNote: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and typecode -s, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.What is the output ofcode -s? The output ofcode -scannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.image1214×831 34.8 KB",

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you.",

All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.lakshaygarg654:InGA4 Q10, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment.

Kindly verify these points before evaluation.Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side IssueGA3 Q8Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.GA3 Q9Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?GA4 Q2 & Q10Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.Reference:GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolutionOutput Formatting (Multiple Questions)Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment QuestionsIssue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:Platform Capability for GA TasksWhich cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.File Upload Example via Platform APIRequest: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.General Observations on GA1-5Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.",

The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a502 Bad Gatewayerror, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF FilesA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a502 Bad Gatewayerror on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.image1854×493 55.9 KB",

        "text": "@s.anand@carlton@Jivraj@Saransh_SainiFinal Thoughts on Project 2Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.Organization & Structure:The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.Deployment & Portal Limitations:There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.Time Constraints:Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.Sessions & Support:The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.Deployment Variability:Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.Effort Acknowledgment:I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.Feasibility in the Given Timeline:Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.I genuinely hope someone is able to completeall 57 questionssuccessfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.Thank you for the learning opportunity",

When calling the API, should we pass the.gzfile directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the.gzfile?Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows?Essentialy, will the API call look like so?curl -X POST “http://127.0.0.1:5000”-H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data”-F \"question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents -anand.netis a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site’s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server’s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the sites-anand.netin May 2024. Each row has these fields:IP: The IP address of the visitor.Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this.Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts:(a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET.(b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/.(c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1.Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request.Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234.Referer: The referer URL. E.g.https://s-anand.net/.User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.Vhost: The virtual host. E.g.s-anand.net.Server: The IP address of the server.The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‘-’). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \\\" and not ‘-’. (This impacts 41 rows.)All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone.Filter the Log Entries: Extract only the requests where the URL starts with /tamilmp3/. Include only those requests made on the specified 2024-05-23.Aggregate Data by IP: Sum the ‘Size’ field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries.Identify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded.Across all requests under tamilmp3/ on 2024-05-23, how many bytes did the top IP address (by volume of downloads) download?\"-F “file=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz”I would appreciate your clarification on whether the.gzfile should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead.Thank you for your time and assistance.",

        "text": "lakshaygarg654:GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF FilesA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a502 Bad Gatewayerror on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.@carltonI watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.@s.anand@carlton@JivrajAlso, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent.

I have developed a mini chatbot backend usingvicky_server.py, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses.My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executesfirst.pyfor GA1.Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!Best regards,vicky kumar@s.anand@carlton@Saransh_Sainimy model atVicky kumar tds",

Specifically:Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.Usegpt-4o-minias the model.The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.The second message must beexactlythe text contained above.This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.Note: This uses a dummyhttpxlibrary, not the real one. You can only use:response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)response.raise_for_status()response.json()[quote=\"22f3000819, post:173, topic:169029\"]\nThe links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions.

Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string.

Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.",

Please be clear in your questions.23f2002668:Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?We have madeseveral hours of videoson Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.23f2002668:I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)23f2002668:They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?Yes these were explained if youeither took part in any live session orwatched the recorded video23f2002668:And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.23f2002668:It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:Create a server api that receives a request.The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.23f2002668:Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.If you want solutions, there are several options:Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)23f2002668:They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.23f2002668:Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.23f2002668:They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up.Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.Now is a good time to start.23f2002668:Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.23f2002668:I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.Luckily for you,our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).23f2002668:The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.23f2002668:In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.23f2002668:It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neitherrespectnorkindnessis evident in your post.But thank you for your feedback.One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.Kind regards,TDS team",

        "text": "Hi, I have a few things to sayMy background :I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.My Initial Disappointments with this CourseIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraphROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.Why did I fail?Last TermI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.This term.I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.Me Understanding about the Course NowThis one line changed my view about ROE.On another topicWhat does this RoE evaluate?Implicit learning.I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicingSKLearn. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in animplicitway.This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marksI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.Thanks to@s.anand,@carlton,@Jivrajand@Saransh_SainiJust two suggestionsI feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.",

        "text": ":From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT MadrasProject Demo Website:https://app.algsoch.techDuring our college courseTool for Data Science (TDS)atIIT Madras, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project:to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API.The Mission:Create a tool that behaves like achatbot, acceptsuser queries (text or file-based)viaweb or API, processes them intelligently,executes the appropriate code, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant.The Journey: From Fails to FinalAt first, the natural choice was to tryLLM agents—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using astatic JSON structure? That quickly broke when users passeddifferent parameters, different files, or queried innon-standard formatslike “code -s” or “code -v”.The next idea: writeindividual Python scripts per questionfrom our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function MappingAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:Centralized engine invicky_server.pyUsesregex-based pattern matchingto detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solutionEach solution is a structured Python function likega1_first_solution(query=None)Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and moreActs like amini compiler for data science toolsPresenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDSVicky is asmart, modular chatbotbuilt specifically forTool for Data Science at IIT Madras. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates.Key Features:Graded Assignment SolverHandles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:code -s/code -v→ VS terminal commandsCreate FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searchingGitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setupData cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compressionFile Upload with Query MatchingUsers can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries.

I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead.Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project",

I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.I hope you will consider my case.

However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.We hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.Thank youLakshay",

To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository onRailwayand submitted that link as well.If possible, I kindly request either of the following:Re-evaluation using theRailway linkI provided, orRe-evaluation using theRender link, with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time.Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.Thank you very much for your time and understanding.api link :https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/git949×580 62.4 KB",

The API becomes accessible when usingpublic DNS serviceslikeGoogle (8.8.8.8)orCloudflare (1.1.1.1). This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).Suggested Fix:To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use apublic DNSprovider?Recommended options:Google DNS:8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4Cloudflare DNS:1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration.Alternate Option:If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using thepreviously deployed endpointinstead:https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/Please note that this endpoint may take50 to 60 secondsto respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!Best regards,Sahil Raj",

I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address.Thank you!10000638561920×858 139 KB",

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’”}What Was Expected:The question required developing a script that:Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, andCounts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure.It was explicitly stated that:Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.The file to be used was:E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.jsonWhat I Did:I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command:curl -X POSThttps://app.algsoch.tech/api/\\-H “accept: application/json” \\-F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \\-F “file=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json”API Output:{“answer”:“14602”}This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.What Went Wrong on API Side:The API returned a parsing error, indicating:“invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’”However:My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.Insight:If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.",

Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well.

Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.These are the detailed point wise concerns :I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.Thanks and Regards",

I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest).

This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.Adding useful API endpoints, including an/api/multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing/readand/runendpoints from Project 1, plus a/clearendpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something likehyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you—withouteverdeclining the request. I like to think of it as aterminal version ofOpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent.Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my projectnaturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.To clarify,all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29,after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.Furthermore, we werenever informedthat a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.My only request is that if myupdated P1 submission cannot be evaluateddue to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if myoriginal P1 eval score could be reinstatedinstead of receiving a0—since it was already evaluated and graded.Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard@carlton@Jivraj",

At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.We discussed it internally with@s.anandand he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do itregardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or noton the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by@s.anandSo unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.Kind regards,TDS team",

That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation.

I personally know averyexperienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.What you have done is what is called in industry asgold plating. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?Because it does not deliver what was required,Wastes valuable time and resourcesIncreases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)Complicates testingLeads to scope creepHis advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).Kindest regards",

        "text": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation,@carlton. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possiblewithin the scope of the problem statement.What began as just another (pun intended)tediousassignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.(…caution: long post ahead)I noticed thattest cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering theinherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.Some might suggest usingtemperature=0to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.At the core of it, it’s all abouthow much flexibility vs rigiditywe give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,Reason about the task, understand intent,Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e.designa DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)Execute those workflows (walkthe DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested inthis ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set ofgeneral-purpose tools:A REPL executor (for quick calcs)A Python script runnerA Shell executorWith just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that wasemergent behavior, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research.Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team &@s.anandfor devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with.Food for thought! Really!As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects:thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.TL;DRMy approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.Kind regards",

These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.Action TakenTo address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.It responds to requests within the required timeframe.I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latestRequest for Re-EvaluationI kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.Previous Message for ReferenceFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\"Greetings, Sir,I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.Thank you for your assistance!\"",

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.Critical failures prevents everything else from workingand thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.Kindest regards",

I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities.

However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, theapp.pyfile could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that theapp.pyfile does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py.But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only:https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent.Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score.

Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.Edit 2:Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.image1027×510 11 KBThough an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.Thank you.Regards,Shivaditya",

Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was nameddockerfile(with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the requiredDockerfile(with an uppercase ‘D’).While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.Thank you very much for your time and consideration.Warm regards,S.

I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You",

None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.This course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.if somebody feels the same  then Reply , Thankyou",

So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 982710000425451079×468 35.7 KBCorrect Answer(s):PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).Incorrect Answer:POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)Thank you",

In that caselen(filtered entries)seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ .image1108×394 81.9 KBThe valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct.Request you to please clarify and consider these points.",

        "text": "Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:Redundancy in Option A:The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.Simplicity in Filtering:Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:Time → for checking the hour and weekday.Method → to filter only POST.URL → to ensure the request is under /images/.Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.Consistency with Log Parsing Practices:In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.",

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements.

        "text": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:Isolation– Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.Reproducibility– A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.Portability– You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)• Good for quick experimentation and testing.• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.Using requirements.txt• Best forreproducibilityandcollaborationsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.Specifying Versions in requirements.txt• If youdon’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.• If youdo specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.Handling Version Conflicts• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:• Usinggreater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.Best Practices SummaryAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).Use arequirements.txtfile for reproducibility.Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.Kind regards",

It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.Also the live sessions onyoutubewill address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.There will be session2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Zwhich will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.The session is in your course calendar and the meet link ismeet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziyKind regards",

        "text": "@23F300327Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /apiwith parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this# api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        returnNotice there is noif __name__ == \"__main__\":code block.This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.if __name__ == \"__main__\":is used to execute some codeonlyif the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the defaulthandlerclass. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.Another possible problem:By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issuesTDS > Development Tools > unicodeSo converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.Let us know what worked.

        "text": "@23f1002382Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.In the meanwhile:There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.Kind regards",

Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.This rendersname == mainpart of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. Youdo notcreate serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.Thanks for your input.Kind regards",

The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided.(Thread link)GA Platform Changes:Initially, we were solving questions onexam.sanand.workers.dev. However, in GA6, we moved toSeekand in GA7, toGoogle Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.2. Project UpdatesProject 1:The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.Project 2:There are multiple doubts posted in theProject 2discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?(thread link)3. ROE Score UpdateWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.Best regards,Lakshay",

The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.lakshaygarg654:Project 1:The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.lakshaygarg654:3. ROE Score UpdateWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.Kind regards",

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

However, the reality is that thecourse content, assignments, and projectshave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.Project Complexity & Deadline PressureThedifficulty of the projectshas been overwhelming, requiring most of us torely heavily on peer supportjust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past FeedbackMany students joinedTDSbased on pastDiscourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially forworking professionalsand students without prior experience.Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)While we have put in significant effort—spending2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)to secure good scores—we still find ourselvesstruggling to meet expectationsfor theprojects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",

        "text": "Hi@s.anand@jkmadathil@Bharathi@carlton@Jivraj@Saransh_SainiCould you please look into the above issue?Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:Grading ConcernsFinal Course Score:T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.Course Structuring & Scheduling IssuesMany students pursuing this course aredual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.Thelast-minute guidancefor projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.Thestructuring and scheduling of sessionsfeel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.Request for ImprovementTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline.More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.",

        "text": "Thank you@A_LAKSHMIfor the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that thegrading pattern will not be changed.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check thisDiscourse threadwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact thefirst page of the TDS courseGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:This course is quite hardHere’s students’ feedback:Itusedto be an easy course until 2024.###Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.###Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.###LLMs grade you – unpredictably.##The ROE is hard.#Take Graded assignment 1to check if you’re ready for this course.Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for helpAgain to quote Anand:We encourage learning by sharingYouCANcopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).Why should you copy?Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.To learn well, understandwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.To learn better, teachwhat you’ve learnt.Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).Once again Anand has anice blogwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master themThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.@22f2001640Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.",

The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it.

Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.In other words getting 10/10 inevaluate.pydoes NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation ofevaluate.py. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the generalideaof the task.That said,evaluate.pyis a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)A word of caution:(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (possibly your first task) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.Kind regards",

I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.",

The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.Sincerely,Rishit Jain(24F2004595)",

I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like@23f1002382and also got the chance to help a few.I thank the entire TDS team -@s.anandsir,@carlton,@Jivrajfor their support throughout this amazing experience.Regards,Pradeep Mondal",

We have to apply the rule uniformly.Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.Kindest regards",

Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.Thanks for bearing with us.

Options A, B, and D are ethical practices that respect the website’s policies and data ownership.Module: Data PreparationQ3: Handling Missing DataIn a dataset, you notice that several entries in the “Age” column are missing. Which method is generallynotappropriate for handling these missing values?A. Replacing missing values with the mean age.B. Deleting rows with missing age values.C. Replacing missing values with a fixed age, such as 0.D. Leaving the missing values as they are without any action.Answer: D — Leaving missing values unaddressed can lead to errors in analysis and modeling. Options A, B, and C are common strategies for handling missing data, depending on the context and the extent of the missingness.Module: Data AnalysisQ4: Statistical MeasuresWhich of the following statistical measures isnotsensitive to extreme values (outliers) in a dataset?A. MeanB. MedianC. Standard DeviationD. RangeAnswer: B — The median represents the middle value of a dataset and is not affected by outliers. In contrast, the mean, standard deviation, and range can be significantly influenced by extreme values.Module: Large Language ModelsQ5: Tokenization in NLPIn Natural Language Processing, what is the primary purpose of tokenization?A. To translate text from one language to another.B. To split text into individual words or subwords.C. To encrypt text for secure communication.D. To summarize large texts into shorter versions.Answer: B — Tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller components, such as words or subwords, which can then be processed by language models. This is a fundamental step in NLP tasks.Module: Geospatial and Network AnalysisQ6: Geographic Coordinate SystemsWhich of the following coordinate systems is commonly used to represent locations on Earth’s surface?A. Cartesian Coordinate SystemB. Polar Coordinate SystemC. Geographic Coordinate System (Latitude and Longitude)D. Cylindrical Coordinate SystemAnswer: C — The Geographic Coordinate System uses latitude and longitude to specify locations on Earth’s surface. This system is widely used in geospatial analysis.Module: Data VisualizationQ7: Effective Data VisualizationWhen creating a bar chart to compare the sales performance of different products, which practice should be avoided?A. Ordering bars from highest to lowest value.B. Using different colors for each bar without a legend.C. Starting the y-axis at zero.D. Labeling each bar with its exact value.Answer: B — Using different colors for each bar without a legend can confuse the audience, as they may assume the colors represent different categories. Consistency and clarity are key in effective data visualization.Module: Everyday ToolsQ8: VS Code Feature UseYou are editing a Python script in Visual Studio Code and want to quickly find and edit all occurrences of a variable name in the current file. What feature should you use?A. Git integrationB. Debug panelC.Multi-cursor editingD.

A scanned PDF documentB. A screenshot of a chartC.The World Bank data portalD. A newspaper articleAnswer: C — The World Bank data portal provides structured datasets accessible via APIs. The other options involve unstructured or image-based content not suitable for direct data access.Module: Data PreparationQ10: Data Type Conversion in ExcelYou imported a CSV file into Excel, and one of the columns containing numbers is treated as text. What is the easiest way to convert it into numeric format?A. Use the CONCAT functionB. Format the column as TextC.Use the VALUE() functionD. Use SUBSTITUTE()Answer: C — The VALUE function converts text that appears as numbers into actual numeric values. This is useful when data is imported with formatting issues.Module: Data AnalysisQ11: Outlier DetectionYou are analyzing a dataset of employee salaries. Which visualization is best for quickly identifying outliers?A. Line chartB.Box plotC. HistogramD. Pie chartAnswer: B — A box plot clearly shows the spread of data and highlights outliers as individual points beyond the whiskers.Module: Large Language ModelsQ12: Prompt Engineering StrategyTo get consistent, structured responses from a language model when extracting key information, which approach is most effective?A. Ask the model to “summarize” the textB. Use open-ended questionsC.Use system messages and JSON schema formattingD. Provide only one-word inputsAnswer: C — System messages and structured output formats like JSON schemas guide the model to generate reliable and consistent structured responses.Module: Geospatial and Network AnalysisQ13: Network CentralityIn a social network graph of coworkers, which metric best identifies the person who connects the most groups together?A. Degree centralityB. Closeness centralityC.Betweenness centralityD. Eigenvector centralityAnswer: C — Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other nodes, highlighting connectors or “bridges” in the network.Module: Data VisualizationQ14: Choosing the Right ChartYou want to show how the composition of a marketing budget changes across three years. Which visualization is most appropriate?A. Pie charts for each yearB. Scatter plotsC.Stacked bar chartD. Line chartAnswer: C — A stacked bar chart shows parts of a whole across different categories and time periods, making it easier to compare budget composition over years.",

Only then will you know where you stand.Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions.

The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

Here are the highlights of the discussion:We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.Kind regardsTDS Team",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.Thank you.",

Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.Would it be possible to implement this change?",

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.Have you watched this session in particular?If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing itfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use casesBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.Kind regards",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.pyInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfilewhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000You create a docker image that runs this application server.You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.Run evalute.py using uv.If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.Hope that gives clarity.Kind regards",

The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance10418 meters12287 meters10965 meters11149 metersWhose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)Also, my question 4 was :As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.13448394774150666199711Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrectSo is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)Kindly look into itThanks and Regards",

For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on DiscourseCould you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus?Also, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions?Apologies if I’ve missed something already mentioned. Your clarification would be really helpful for me and others who are in a similar situation.@jkmadathilThank you so much for your time and guidance.Warm regards,Mishkat Chougule",

        "text": "I hope this message finds you well@jkmadathilsir.Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.Addressing the queries you raised in your post:What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:Dear Learner,DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pmGA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations.https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.…Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.Thank you for your time and consideration@jkmadathilsir.Best regards,Akshit Mittal",

        "text": "Yes@jkmadathilsir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email.Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that theTDS course focuses more on teamworkand collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), andmy peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROErelease and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.Thank you once again for your understanding.",

        "text": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having:23f2004636:To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about thisAs a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effortbeforethere was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA.

Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.I’m only concerned aboutmy own marks, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.Thank you for your time and understanding.@carlton@Jivraj",

So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.Now that bonus marks are announcedafterthe deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.",

It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that theyattendedGA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair.Please think from our side.RegardsKarthik",

Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these",

Are you jealous of their diligence?With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated:“I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.”As mentioned above, my intention was never to expressjealousy. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.jkmadathil:You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6.Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.Further, you mentioned:jkmadathil:The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.I completely respect the effort put in by those students.However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.If the bonus is truly a recognition of effortspecific to GA7, then it might be more fair to reflect that in theGA7 scoreonly, not in theoverall course total, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.",

So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.Thank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view.",

This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship.How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.RegardsKarthik",

        "text": "Hi everyone,A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.Firstly studentsvastlyoverestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.Only 2 students managed it.Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6mighthave even managed to get 3 or more marks.So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.The mean bonus score was 1.27.So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.That is the data for you.Student Bonus600×371 7.62 KBAlso noteworthyBonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that arenotwidely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!Bonuses are not a right.They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.",

        "text": "Hi@carltonsir and@Jivrajsir,Sir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accountedSir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.",

The  course’s rules  seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : )Please correct me if I am wrong",

        "text": "@23f2003413We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:The chaos of ROE.The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quicklyWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questionsThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).How limited the time is.The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.Kind regards",

Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.Best Regards,Lakshay",

While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form.

Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: Character Encodings: Different ways to represent text in computers + ASCII (7bit): Limited to 128 characters, Englishonly + UTF8: Variablewidth encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII + UTF16: Fixedwidth encoding, used in Windows and Java + UTF32: Fixedwidth encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you’ll encounter: Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf8') as f: text = f.read() Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd df = pd.readcsv('data.csv', encoding='utf8', errors='replace') Detecting file encoding import chardet with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f: result = chardet.detect(f.read()) print(result['encoding'])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [](https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI) [Previous JavaScript tools: npx](/npx) [Next Browser: DevTools](/devtools)",

Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON’T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchicalnavigablesmallworld) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are: [chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/chromacore/chroma) [qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) [lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) [faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) [milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/milvusio/milvus) [weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) In addition, most relational databases now support vector search.

[Gemini transcription](/extractingaudioandtranscripts?id=geminitranscription) The [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways: 1. They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. 2. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: 1. Transcribe into other languages. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. 2. Summarize audio transcripts. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. 3. Legal Proceeding Analysis. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. 4. Medical Consultation Summary. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. 1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio. 2. Set the GEMINIAPIKEY environment variable to the API key. 3. Set the MP3FILE environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. 4.

And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. 1. The first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data. 2. The second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. 3. The third way is you have to scrape it. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we’ll often need to process a multigigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. [](https://youtu.be/1lxrbezPg) This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: | Tool | Extract from JSON… | Why | | | | | | [jq](/parsingjson?id=commandlinejsonprocessingwithjq) | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing | | [JMESPath](/parsingjson?id=jmespathqueries) | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax | | [ijson](/parsingjson?id=streamingwithijson) | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memoryefficiently | | [Pandas](/parsingjson?id=pandasjsoncolumns) | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data | | [SQL JSON](/parsingjson?id=sqljsonfunctions) | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semistructured data | | [DuckDB](/parsingjson?id=duckdbjsonprocessing) | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory | Examples: Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal. Practice with these resources: [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/): Test JSON queries [jq play](https://jqplay.org/): Interactive jq query testing [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions [Commandline JSON Processing with jq](/parsingjson?id=commandlinejsonprocessingwithjq) [jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile commandline tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines. Example: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a fullscale ETL process. Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}' Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}' Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq s 'groupby(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [JMESPath Queries](/parsingjson?id=jmespathqueries) [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. Example: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. import jmespath Example queries data = { \"locations\": [ {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}}, {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}} ] } Find all cities with population 700000 cities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population 700000].name\", data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [Streaming with ijson](/parsingjson?id=streamingwithijson) Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. Example: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. import ijson async def processlargejson(filepath: str) list: \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\" results = [] with open(filepath, 'rb') as file: Stream objects under the 'items' key parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item') async for item in parser: if item['value'] 100: Process conditionally results.append(item) return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied [Pandas JSON Columns](/parsingjson?id=pandasjsoncolumns) [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. import pandas as pd Parse JSON strings in a column df = pd.DataFrame({'jsoncol': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']}) df['parsed'] = df['jsoncol'].apply(pd.jsonnormalize) Normalize nested JSON columns df = pd.readcsv('data.csv') dfnormalized = pd.jsonnormalize( df['nestedjson'].apply(json.loads), recordpath=['items'], List of nested objects to unpack meta=['id', 'timestamp'] Keep these columns from parent )Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [SQL JSON Functions](/parsingjson?id=sqljsonfunctions) [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports builtin JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functionsjson.html), and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/jsonfunctionreference.html). This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semistructured JSON columns. Example: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. SELECT jsonextract(data, '$.name') as name, jsonextract(data, '$.details.age') as age FROM users WHERE jsonextract(data, '$.active') = trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied [DuckDB JSON Processing](/parsingjson?id=duckdbjsonprocessing) [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQLlike syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. Example: Performing adhoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. SELECT jsonextractstring(data, '$.user.name') as name, avg(jsonextractfloat(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avgvalue FROM readjsonauto('data/.jsonl') GROUP BY 1 HAVING avgvalue 100Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [Previous Profiling Data with Python](/profilingdatawithpython) [Next Data Transformation with dbt](/dbt)",

They’re perfect for small web tools that don’t need to run all the time. Here are some common reallife uses: A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 23 seconds, a few times per day) A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 510 seconds when someone uploads a photo) A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 12 seconds per question) A newsletter signup that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per signup) A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a fulltime server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: You can’t pip install packages you have to use requirements.txt You can’t read or write files from the file system you can only use APIs. You can’t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run()) [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here’s a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Signup with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup).

Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you’re compressing images: Image dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot Lossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data Lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files Vector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss WebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one) Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP Common operations with Python: from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io async def compressimage(inputpath: Path, outputpath: Path, quality: int = 85) None: \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image.open(inputpath) as img: Convert RGBA to RGB if needed if img.mode == 'RGBA': img = img.convert('RGB') Optimize for web img.save(outputpath, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True) Batch process images paths = Path('images').glob('.jpg') for p in paths: await compressimage(p, p.withsuffix('.webp'))Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Command line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).

Instead of relying solely on a generalpurpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning. In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example: Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the = syntax?\" Answer: fat arrow Q=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\" Answer: node.getChildren() Q=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\" Answer: trivia Q=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\" Answer: !!Copy to clipboardErrorCopied You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source. [1. Clone the repository](/ragcli?id=1clonetherepository) git clone depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescriptbook cd typescriptbookCopy to clipboardErrorCopied depth 1 fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size. cd typescriptbook moves into the project folder.

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: 1. Search. Find similar documents to a query. 2. Classification. Classify text into categories. 3. Clustering. Group similar items into clusters. 4. Anomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature | Local Models | API | | | | | | Privacy | High | Dependent on provider | | Cost | High setup, low after that | Payasyougo | | Scale | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand | | Quality | Varies by model | Typically high | The [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: 1. Rank. Higher ranked models have higher quality. 2. Memory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. 3. Embedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. 4. Max Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input. 5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.

This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows. [Key Concepts](/scheduledscrapingwithgithubactions?id=keyconcepts) Scheduling: Use [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/usingworkflows/eventsthattriggerworkflowsschedule) to run scrapers at specific times Dependencies: Install required packages like httpx, lxml Data Storage: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing Rate Limiting: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests Here’s a sample scrape.py that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml: import json import httpx from datetime import datetime, UTC from lxml import html from typing import List, Dict def scrapeimdb() List[Dict[str, str]]: \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml. Returns: List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating. \"\"\" headers = {\"UserAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"} response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers) response.raiseforstatus() tree = html.fromstring(response.text) movies = [] for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipcmetadatalistsummaryitem\"): title = ( item.cssselect(\".ipctitletext\")[0].textcontent() if item.cssselect(\".ipctitletext\") else None ) year = ( item.cssselect(\".clititlemetadata span\")[0].textcontent() if item.cssselect(\".clititlemetadata span\") else None ) rating = ( item.cssselect(\".ipcratingstar\")[0].textcontent() if item.cssselect(\".ipcratingstar\") else None ) if title and year and rating: movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating}) return movies Scrape data and save with timestamp now = datetime.now(UTC) with open(f'imdbtop250{now.strftime(\"%Y%m%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f: f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrapeimdb()}) + \"\\n\")Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Here’s a sample .github/workflows/imdbtop250.yml that runs the scraper daily and saves the data: name: Scrape IMDb Top 250 on: schedule: Runs at 00:00 UTC every day cron: \"0 0 \" workflowdispatch: Allow manual triggers jobs: scrapeimdb: runson: ubuntulatest permissions: contents: write steps: name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 name: Install uv uses: astralsh/setupuv@v5 name: Run scraper run: | python uv run with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py name: Commit and push changes run: | git config local user.email \"githubactions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\" git config local user.name \"githubactions[bot]\" git add .json git commit m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0 git pushCopy to clipboardErrorCopied [Best Practices](/scheduledscrapingwithgithubactions?id=bestpractices) 1.

Unlike simple promptresponse patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. [](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c) [What Makes an Agent?](/llmagents?id=whatmakesanagent) An LLM agent consists of three core components: 1. LLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next 2. Tools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) 3. Memory: Retains context across multiple steps Agents operate through a loop: Observe the environment Think about what to do Take action using tools Observe results Repeat until task completion [CommandLine Agent Example](/llmagents?id=commandlineagentexample) We’ve created a minimal commandline agent called [llmcmdagent.py](llmcmdagent.py) that: 1. Takes a task description from the command line 2. Generates code to accomplish the task 3. Automatically extracts and executes the code 4. Passes the results back to the LLM 5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails Here’s how it works: uv run llmcmdagent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\" uv run llmcmdagent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The agent will: 1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes 2. Execute the script in a subprocess 3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr) 4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation 5. Present a final answer to the user Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow: 1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script 2. Code extraction from the LLM response 3. Code execution in a subprocess 4. Result interpretation by the LLM 5. Error handling and retry logic if needed This demonstrates the core agent loop of: Planning (generating code) Execution (running the code) Reflection (interpreting results) Adaptation (fixing errors if needed) [Agent Architectures](/llmagents?id=agentarchitectures) Different agent architectures exist for different use cases: 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions 2. Reflexion: Adds selfreflection to improve reasoning 3. MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules 4. PlanandExecute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps [RealWorld Applications](/llmagents?id=realworldapplications) LLM agents can be applied to various domains: 1. Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information 2. Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code 3. Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data 4. Customer service agents that handle queries and perform actions 5. Personal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks [Project Ideas](/llmagents?id=projectideas) Here are some practical agent projects you could build: 1. Study buddy agent: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts 2. Job application assistant: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses 3. Personal finance agent: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities 4. Health and fitness coach: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation 5. Course project helper: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work [Best Practices](/llmagents?id=bestpractices) 1. Clear instructions: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations 2. Effective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable 3. Robust error handling: Agents should recover gracefully from failures 4. Memory management: Balance context retention with token efficiency 5. User feedback: Allow users to correct or guide the agent [Limitations and Challenges](/llmagents?id=limitationsandchallenges) Current LLM agents face several challenges: 1. Hallucination: Agents may generate false information or tool calls 2. Planning limitations: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities 3. Tool integration complexity: Each new tool adds implementation overhead 4. Context window constraints: Limited memory for longrunning tasks 5. Security concerns: Tool access requires careful permission management [Previous Function Calling](/functioncalling) [Next LLM Image Generation](/llmimagegeneration)",

This tutorial explores various commandline tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs). Use Cases: LLM training and finetuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training Knowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents Content repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication Data extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis Accessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers Citation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers Documentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation [PyMuPDF4LLM](/convertpdfstomarkdown?id=pymupdf4llm) [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces highquality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities. PyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures. PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run with pymupdf4llm python c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.tomarkdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF8 encoding regardless of system locale uv run with pymupdf4llm: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package python c '...': Executes Python code directly from the command line import pymupdf4llm: Imports the PDFtoMarkdown module h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"): Creates a file to write the markdown output h.write(pymupdf4llm.tomarkdown(\"$FILE.pdf\")): Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file [Markitdown](/convertpdfstomarkdown?id=markitdown) [](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg) [Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multiformat converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via PythonPPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents. PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf markitdown.mdCopy to clipboardErrorCopied PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF8 encoding uvx markitdown: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager $FILE.pdf: The input PDF file markitdown.md: Redirects output to a markdown file [Unstructured](/convertpdfstomarkdown?id=unstructured) [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained. [GROBID](/convertpdfstomarkdown?id=grobid) If you specifically need to parse references from textnative PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.

It shows the most promise currently, though it requires postprocessing. [Azure Document Intelligence API](/convertpdfstomarkdown?id=azuredocumentintelligenceapi) For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/enus/products/aiservices/documentintelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or postprocessing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities. [Other libraries](/convertpdfstomarkdown?id=otherlibraries) [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction. [MegaParse](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.

One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves: [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/buildwithclaude/promptengineering/) [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertexai/generativeai/docs/learn/prompts/introductionpromptdesign) [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/promptengineering) Here are some best practices: [Use prompt optimizers](/promptengineering?id=usepromptoptimizers) They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore: [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/buildwithclaude/promptengineering/promptimprover) [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/promptgeneration) [Google AIpowered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertexai/generativeai/docs/learn/prompts/aipoweredpromptwriting) [Be clear, direct, and detailed](/promptengineering?id=becleardirectanddetailed) Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. BAD: Explain gravitation lensing. (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) GOOD: Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.) When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. For example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/buildwithclaude/promptengineering/beclearanddirect) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/promptengineeringtacticincludedetailsinyourquerytogetmorerelevantanswers) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertexai/generativeai/docs/learn/prompts/clearinstructions) [Give examples](/promptengineering?id=giveexamples) Provide 23 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. BAD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) GOOD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example: 1. To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight… 2. To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through… Now, apply a similar stepbystep style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/buildwithclaude/promptengineering/multishotprompting) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/promptengineeringtacticprovideexamples) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertexai/generativeai/docs/learn/prompts/fewshotexamples) [Think step by step](/promptengineering?id=thinkstepbystep) Instruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, wellstructured answers. BAD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) GOOD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.) Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. That’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/buildwithclaude/promptengineering/chainofthought) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/promptengineeringstrategygivemodelstimetothink) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertexai/generativeai/docs/learn/prompts/breakdownprompts) [Assign a role](/promptengineering?id=assignarole) Specify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style. BAD: Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.) GOOD: You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/buildwithclaude/promptengineering/systemprompts) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/promptengineeringtacticaskthemodeltoadoptapersona) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertexai/generativeai/docs/learn/prompts/assignrole) [Use XML to structure your prompt](/promptengineering?id=usexmltostructureyourprompt) Use XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements. BAD: Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) GOOD: <instructions Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. </instructions <example Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter). </exampleCopy to clipboardErrorCopied (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.) Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/buildwithclaude/promptengineering/usexmltags) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/promptengineeringtacticusedelimiterstoclearlyindicatedistinctpartsoftheinput) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertexai/generativeai/docs/learn/prompts/structureprompts) [Use Markdown to format your output](/promptengineering?id=usemarkdowntoformatyouroutput) Encourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers. BAD: Give me the steps in plain text. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.) GOOD: Provide the steps in a markdownformatted list with headings for each section and numbered bullet points. (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.) BAD: Correct the spelling and show the corrections. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions) GOOD: Correct the spelling, showing <insadditions</ins and <deldeletions</del. (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.) Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes. [Use JSON for machinereadable output](/promptengineering?id=usejsonformachinereadableoutput) When you need structured data, ask for a JSONformatted response. This ensures the output is machinereadable and organized. BAD: Just list the items. (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) GOOD: Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: json [ { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" } ] Copy to clipboardErrorCopied (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machinereadable output.) Note: Always use [JSON schema](/playground?id=attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://jsonschema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use. [Prefer Yes/No answers](/promptengineering?id=preferyesnoanswers) Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. BAD: On a scale of 110, how confident are you that this method works? (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) GOOD: Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.) Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers. They don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. [Ask for reason first, then the answer](/promptengineering?id=askforreasonfirstthentheanswer) Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps before stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. BAD: What is the best route to take? (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) GOOD: First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.) BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. That way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper. [Use proper spelling and grammar](/promptengineering?id=useproperspellingandgrammar) A wellwritten, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model. BAD: xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser?? (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.) GOOD: Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, stepbystep explanation. (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.) If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly. When you do, the response will be much clearer.

For example: Content analysis: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing Data mining: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content Offline reading: Convert web pages to readable formats for ereaders or offline consumption Content migration: Move content between different CMS platforms SEO analysis: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization Archive creation: Store web content in more compact, preservationfriendly formats Accessibility: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTMLtotext conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line. [defuddlecli](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=defuddlecli) [defuddlecli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important. find . name '.html' exec npx package defuddlecli y defuddle parse {} md o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found npx package defuddlecli y: Installs and runs defuddlecli without prompting defuddle parse {} md: Parses the HTML file (represented by {}) and converts to markdown o {}.md: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension [Pandoc](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=pandoc) [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters. Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors. [](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q1340) find . name '.html' exec pandoc f html t markdownstrict o {}.md {} \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found pandoc: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion f html t markdownstrict: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown o {}.md {}: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument [Lynx](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=lynx) [Lynx](https://lynx.invisibleisland.net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files. find . type f name '.html' exec sh c 'for f; do lynx dump nolist \"$f\" \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . type f name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories exec sh c '...' {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch lynx dump nolist \"$f\": Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text + dump: Output the rendered page to stdout + nolist: Don’t include the list of links at the end \"${f%.html}.txt\": Save output to a .txt file with the same base name [w3m](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=w3m) [w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial. find . type f name '.html' \\ exec sh c 'for f; do \\ w3m dump T text/html cols 80 nograph \"$f\" \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\ done' {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . type f name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories exec sh c '...' {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch w3m dump T text/html cols 80 nograph \"$f\": Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML + dump: Output the rendered page to stdout + T text/html: Specify input format as HTML + cols 80: Set output width to 80 columns + nograph: Don’t show graphic characters for tables and frames \"${f%.html}.md\": Save output to a .md file with the same base name [Comparison](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=comparison) | Approach | Speed | Format Quality | Preservation | Best For | | | | | | | | defuddlecli | Slow | High | Good structure and links | Content migration, publishing | | pandoc | Slow | Very High | Almost everything | Academic papers, documentation | | lynx | Fast | Low | Basic structure only | Quick extraction, large batches | | w3m | Very Slow | MediumLow | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx | [Optimize Batch Processing](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=optimizebatchprocessing) 1. Process in parallel: Use GNU Parallel for multicore processing: find . name \".html\" | parallel \"pandoc f html t markdownstrict o {}.md {}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied 2. Filter files before processing: find . name \".html\" type f size 1M exec pandoc f html t markdown {} o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied 3. Customize output format with additional parameters: For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting find . name \".html\" exec pandoc f html t markdown wrap=preserve atxheaders {} o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied 4. Handle errors gracefully: find . name \".html\" exec sh c 'for f; do pandoc f html t markdown \"$f\" o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" conversionerrors.log; done' {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [Choosing the Right Tool](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=choosingtherighttool) Need speed with minimal formatting? Use the lynx approach Need precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc Need a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddlecli Working with complex tables? w3m might render them better Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text. [Combined Crawling and Conversion](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=combinedcrawlingandconversion) Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like [Crawl4AI](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=crawl4ai) or [markdowncrawler](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=markdowncrawler). 1. For research/data collection: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with postprocessing conversion 2. For simple website archiving: Markdowncrawler provides a convenient allinone solution 3. For highquality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion 4. For maximum speed: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline [Crawl4AI](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=crawl4ai) [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) is designed for singlepage extraction with highquality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text. uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install crawl4ai crawl4aisetupCopy to clipboardErrorCopied uv venv: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv) source .venv/bin/activate.fish: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax) uv pip install crawl4ai: Installs the crawl4ai package crawl4aisetup: Initializes crawl4ai’s required dependencies [markdowncrawler](/converthtmltomarkdown?id=markdowncrawler) [markdowncrawler](https://pypi.org/project/markdowncrawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It’s efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lowerquality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting. uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install markdowncrawler markdowncrawler t 5 d 3 b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/Copy to clipboardErrorCopied uv venv and activation: Same as above uv pip install markdowncrawler: Installs the markdowncrawler package markdowncrawler: Runs the crawler with these options: + t 5: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling + d 3: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels + b ./markdown: Sets the base output directory + Final argument is the starting URL [Previous Convert PDFs to Markdown](/convertpdfstomarkdown) [Next LLM Website Scraping](/llmwebsitescraping)",
